    "__Trend__:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear. Sometimes we will refer to a trend as “changing direction”, when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Seasonality__:\n",
    "\n",
    "A seasonal pattern occurs when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week. Seasonality is always of a __fixed and known frequency__. The monthly sales of antidiabetic drugs above shows seasonality which is induced partly by the change in the cost of the drugs at the end of the calendar year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- every weekend or every holiday sales may go up\n",
    "- every weekday 9am-12 pm traffic may increase\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal - this pattern will generalize in future\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclic - say gold price suddenly spiked in Nov due to some govt policy - hard\n",

    "The fig on top left is __additive seasonality__ - we can see that there is seasonality but the __magnitude__ of the \n",
    "seasononality is constant\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2nd fig (top right) - there is a positive trend, but seasonality magnitude is constant\n",
    "\n",
    "bottom left - no trend, but seasonality has an increasing pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "bottom right - increasing trend, increasing seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cyclic__:\n",
    "\n",
    "A cycle occurs when the data exhibit rises and falls that are not of a fixed frequency. These fluctuations are usually due to economic conditions, and are often related to the “business cycle”. The duration of these fluctuations is usually at least 2 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people confuse cyclic behaviour with seasonal behaviour, but they are really quite different. If the fluctuations are not of a fixed frequency then they are cyclic; if the frequency is unchanging and associated with some aspect of the calendar, then the pattern is seasonal. In general, the average length of cycles is longer than the length of a seasonal pattern, and the magnitudes of cycles tend to be more variable than the magnitudes of seasonal patterns.\n",
